Cipherpoint Limited has reviewed its corporate governance practices against the Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (3rd Edition) published by the ASX Corporate Governance Council.\\n\\nDetails of the corporate governance report is available on the Group website at https://cipherpoint.com/ir/#governance\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Directors' report 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nThe directors present their report, together with the financial statements, on the consolidated entity (referred to hereafter as the 'Group') consisting of Cipherpoint Limited (referred to hereafter as the 'Company' or 'parent entity') and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year ended 31 March 2020.\\n\\n## Directors\\n\\nThe following persons were directors of the Company during the whole of the financial period and up to the date of this report, unless otherwise stated:\\n\\nEdward Pretty - Executive Chairman Steven Bliim - Executive Director and COO Graham Mirabito - Non-Executive Director (appointed 1 November 2019) William McCluggage - Former Non-Executive Chairman (resigned 31 October 2019)\\n\\n## Principal activities\\n\\nThe principal activity of the Group is the development and commercialisation of intellectual property primarily in the field of data security technology.\\n\\n## Dividends\\n\\nThere were no dividends paid, recommended or declared during the current or previous financial year.\\n\\n## Review of operations\\n\\nThe loss for the Group after providing for income tax amounted to $673,045 (31 March 2019: $8,333,570).\\n\\nIn 2019, the Group changed its financial year from 30 June to 31 March. The financial statements have been prepared for the year ended 31 March 2020, while the comparative accounting period is for the 9 months ended 31 March 2019, therefore the results are not directly comparable.\\n\\nAs at 31 March 2020, the Group held $920,935 (2019: $1,605,067) in cash and term deposits.\\n\\n## Highlights\\n\\n- In May 2019, the Group announced that it had signed a master Supply and Services agreement with DHL Information Services (Europe) s.r.o. (DHL). The initial order was to the value of €244,360.\\n- The Group consolidated its issued capital on the basis that every 20 fully paid ordinary shares be consolidated into 1 fully paid ordinary share. The purpose of the consolidation is to implement a more appropriate capital structure for the Group.\\n- The Company established its base for European operations in November 2019 in Heilbronn, Germany.\\n\\n## Product update\\n\\nWith the divestiture of SafeShare, Cipherpoint's focus is on the remaining products cp.Protect and cp.Discover as well as continuing to look for opportunities to resell dataglobal GmbH's (' datagloba l') content services capabilities.\\n\\nThis change in focus and rebranding to Cipherpoint required a significant upgrade to the website and collateral which was completed in November 2019 and has now evolved into a second phase which began in December 2019 with search engine optimisation and improvements in online lead generation.\\n\\nKey development work undertaken during the financial year to 31 March 2020 included:\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Directors' report 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## cp.Protect\\n\\n- Version  10.1.2:    This  incremental  update  included  improvements  to  Agentless  Eclipse  (for  SharePoint  Online/ OneDrive protection), permission enforcement, security and usability. Customers have been advised the Company is no longer supporting versions older than version 10 and the support team is working with customers to assist in upgrading.\\n- Version 10.3.3:  This version included support for SharePoint 2019, customer supplied encryption hardware (HSM), Active Directory integration, performance improvements and bug fixes.\\n- Projects are currently underway to improve both user interface and user experience as well as improve the underlying performance of cp.Protect. These products are anticipated for completion in the quarter ending 30 June 2020.\\n\\n## cp.Discover:\\n\\n## cp.OEM\\n\\nA framework to allow third party application developers to use cp.Protect within their own products has been prepared and is being offered to potential customers. Further investment in this will depend on market interest.\\n\\n## cp.Cloud and cp.Cloud+\\n\\nThis is a major roadmap initiative to further extend the application of our existing cp.Protect value proposition to online data  repositories  and  collaboration  tools. cp.Cloud  which  offers  enterprises  a  single  console  for  data  control  is  now complete and cp.Cloud+, now under development, will enable enterprises to create and manage their own encryption keys for sensitive information that resides inside of Office 365, SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams. This requires a new approach for the technology and is anticipated to be completed by the quarter ending 31 December 2020. Marketing\\n\\nIn November 2019, the group undertook a complete redesign of the Company's branding and website. The objective of the redesign was to more easily distinguish the core capability of the Company's stable of products as well as improve the ease with which potential customers could find the Company on the internet.\\n\\nFollowing the rebranding and redesign, focus quickly shifted to improving performance of the Group's lead generation and digital marketing capability. The Company retained a dedicated digital marketing resource in Europe. This subsequent work has involved improving the readability of the Company's product pages on the website as well as requiring small investment in advertising through channels such as Google, LinkedIn and Xing as well as launching a series of campaigns targeted at potential decision makers highlighting which problems the Company's products solve.\\n\\nAs a result, the Group has experienced a dramatic increase in monthly inbound leads, from an average of 10 leads per month to in excess of 50 leads per month. Another consequence of these improvements has seen a dramatic increase in the Company's search rankings on Google, particularly in Europe. This means that the Company can more easily be found  by  those  organisations  searching  for  solutions  to  common  data  protection,  digital  transformation  and  risk management problems.\\n\\n## Channel Development\\n\\nCipherpoint has renewed its focus on building a channel partner network for the revised product set, whilst continuing to support  direct  sales  where  needed  to  establish  market  presence  and  gain  firsthand  experience  in  relation  to  how customers are using the products. Progress has been good and key highlights are:\\n\\n## ● Asia Pacific\\n\\nThree new sales through our Singapore partner, Total eBusiness Solutions. A partnership agreement with a larger Australian based consulting services company is progressing with discussions on how to lead engagement with our target segments continuing.\\n\\n## ● Europe\\n\\nCipherpoint GmbH was established in Germany in November 2019 to support DHL and expand business in the Germany-Austrian and Swiss (DACH) region of Europe.  To that end, Steven Bliim relocated to Germany along with one of our senior engineers. Deployment with DHL has moved from staging and is now in production with new users being added to the platform each month. Progress has been made with a number of strategic opportunities surfacing during this time as well the engagement of new channel partners and resellers for the region. The level of interest has confirmed our view that the European market continues to maintain an interest in additional protection of onprem SharePoint instances and will be ready to maintain that level of control once they are ready to commence transition to cloud instances of SharePoint.\\n\\n## ● America\\n\\nCipherpoint is not proactively pursuing partners in these territories, but online marketing has seen a lift in interest from potential customers and partners.  The Company has signed a partnership agreement with a managed service provider and continues to receive maintenance and services renewals from existing partners and direct customers it has worked with previously.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Directors' report 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nCipherpoint - entering FY2021 with renewed confidence\\n\\nAs detailed throughout this report, the year has seen the Group's growth in capability and opportunity.\\n\\nThe Board would like to publicly thank all involved at Cipherpoint for their hard work and dedication over the past year and look forward to seeing results from the valued work they do.\\n\\n## Significant changes in the state of affairs\\n\\nThe Group changed its name to Cipherpoint Limited (ASX: CPT) from Covata Limited (ASX: CVT) following the general meeting on 17 December 2019 consistent with the Company's renewed focus on the cp.Protect product.\\n\\n## Divestment of SafeShare\\n\\nThe Group completed the disposal of the SafeShare business to Cyber 5 Pty Ltd in July 2019 for $5 million, which was discharged as follows:\\n\\n- $2 million through the extinguishment of the Group's obligations under convertible notes;\\n- $2 million in cash at completion of the sale; and\\n- $1 million in the form of a vendor terms loan from Cipherpoint (on terms which would be customary for unsecured loans obtained from any major Australian bank, such as a business overdraft account, or such other terms as agreed between Cybr5 and Cipherpoint).\\n\\nThe sale was subject to a global, perpetual, royalty-free licence of the IP and platforms developed by Cocoon and Covata Australia  Pty  Limited  ('CVA')  back  to  Cipherpoint  for  use  in  its  ongoing  businesses,  other  than  to  be  used  for  a development of a product not connected to the Group's core product range. Cipherpoint and Cybr5 have also entered into a mutual collaboration and reselling relationship.\\n\\nExcluded from the sale were all assets in and shares of CipherPoint Software, Inc. and all customers of its Eclipse product, the rights to the dataglobal GmbH classification IP, all IP to Cipherpoint's data security console, and all other IP and/or associated technical support and architecture materials which are held outside of Cocoon or CVA.\\n\\nThe sale has freed up resources to allow management to focus on the Eclipse product.\\n\\n## dataglobal\\n\\n- In September 2019, the Company announced that it was no longer pursuing the acquisition of dataglobal GmbH, Heilbronn  ('dataglobal').  Despite  its  best  efforts,  the  Company  was  unable  to  reach  the  minimum  subscription required to complete the proposed transaction with dataglobal under the terms of the offer.\\n- The Board is of the view that the strategy underpinning the acquisition, being a vision to create a content services player, remains compelling. The Board notes it will be open to and will consider all options to pursue the same or alternative transaction(s) in content services going forward, whether in the short or medium term.\\n- The Company continues to enjoy a close relationship with dataglobal.  Notwithstanding the merger transaction is no longer being pursued at this time, dataglobal has offered to support the Company with marketing, channel and direct customer introductions and office accommodation for the business based in Heilbronn Germany. Both parties have agreed to collaborate and will look for further ways to work together.\\n\\n## Resumption of trading\\n\\nFollowing its suspension on 30 January 2019, in connection with the pursuit of the dataglobal transaction, the Company's quoted securities were reinstated to trading by the ASX on 2 December 2019.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Directors' report 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Matters subsequent to the end of the financial year\\n\\nThe following events have arisen since 31 March 2020 which may affect the Group's operations, the results of those operations, or the Group's state of affairs in future financial years.\\n\\n## Asset recovery\\n\\nAs shareholders may be aware the Company was subject to a backdoor listing of its data security business in 2014. At that time, the Company traded as Prime Minerals Limited and held various mining tenements directly and through its subsidiaries.\\n\\nA review of ASX records, annual reports and agreements created at or around that time (copies of which we have now recently obtained) have revealed that in 2008 the Company sold its interests in certain mining exploration tenements in an area known as the Barrambie project in Western Australia. The sale to Neometals Limited (then called Reed Resources Limited) included an entitlement to a Net Smelter Royalty (NSR) of 2% over output from a defined tenement area. The Company is presently seeking advice with respect to the NSR. At this time, the Company has not formed a view on the potential value of the NSR, if any.\\n\\n## Capital raising\\n\\nThe  Company  released  its  Share  Placement  Plan  ('SPP')  Prospectus  on  27  April  2020  to  raise  up  to  $500,000. Shareholders each will be entitled to subscribe for up to $30,000 of shares at a price of 1.3c per share.\\n\\nShareholders will note that the ASX has waived SPP requirements for the number of shares issued to be limited to 30% of the issued capital and the issue price to be at least 80% of the VWAP. The SPP issue price is a matter for reasonable determination by the Board. These temporary measures will expire on 31 July 2020 unless ASX decides to remove or extend them.\\n\\nThe decision of the Board on the terms of the SPP has been made after assessing the alternatives in the context of the Coronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Act 2020, the concessions made by the ASX on capital raisings during the Covid-19 crisis and also reviewing comparable market discounts.\\n\\n## Investment and Co-Venture discussions\\n\\nThe Company has been meeting with potential equity investors in Europe given the focus of the business in that market. All discussions have been conducted under suitable Non-Disclosure Agreements and are preliminary and non-binding in nature. One structure that has been discussed is creating a joint venture entity into which the business of the Company will be transferred with new European investors injecting capital into that vehicle. The Company has taken preliminary advice that, subject to the final terms of any arrangement, this would not be a disposal of its main undertaking as its main undertaking before the transfer will be the same as after any such transfer (i.e. software services). Any such arrangement may require consultation with ASX and potentially shareholder approval. The potential investor is presently conducting due diligence on the business and has spoken with the Company's largest customer. There is no guarantee that these discussions will result in any venture or investment.\\n\\n## COVID-19\\n\\nSubsequent to the reporting date, the existence of the infectious disease COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') has become widely known, and begun to rapidly spread throughout the world, including Australia. The Company considers this to be a nonadjusting event after the reporting date. Since the reporting date this has caused increasing disruption to populations, and to business and economic activity.

The framework aligns executive reward with the achievement of strategic objectives and the creation of value for shareholders, and it is considered to conform to the market best practice for the delivery of reward. The Board of Directors ('the Board') ensures that executive reward satisfies the following key criteria for good reward governance practices:\\n\\n- competitiveness and reasonableness;\\n- acceptability to shareholders;\\n- performance linkage / alignment of executive compensation; and\\n- transparency.\\n\\nThe performance of the Group depends on the quality of its directors and executives. The remuneration philosophy is to attract, motivate and retain high performance and high-quality personnel.\\n\\nIn FY2020, it was the role of the Board to review and make recommendations in relation to the remuneration arrangements for its directors and executives.\\n\\nThe reward framework is designed to align executive reward to shareholders' interests. The Board have considered that it should seek to enhance shareholders' interests by:\\n\\n- having economic profit as a core component of plan design;\\n- focusing on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering constant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and\\n- attracting and retaining high calibre executives.\\n\\nAdditionally, the reward framework should seek to enhance executives' interests by:\\n\\n- rewarding capability and experience;\\n- reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth; and\\n- providing a clear structure for earning rewards.\\n\\nIn accordance with best practice corporate governance, the structure of non-executive director and executive director remuneration is separate.\\n\\n## Non-executive directors' remuneration\\n\\nFees and payments to non-executive directors reflect the demands which are made on, and the responsibilities of, these directors. The Board decides the total amount paid to each non-executive director as remuneration for their services as a director.\\n\\nAs described in the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Board may elect at their discretion to issue share options to nonexecutive directors in order to attract individuals who bring the necessary leadership and strategic skills to the Group.\\n\\nASX listing rules require the aggregate non-executive directors' remuneration be determined periodically by a general meeting.  The  most  recent  determination  was  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  held  on  7  August  2019,  where  the shareholders approved a maximum annual aggregate remuneration of $480,000.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Directors' report 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Executive remuneration\\n\\nThe Group aims to reward executives based on their position and responsibility, with a level and mix of remuneration which has both fixed and variable components.\\n\\nThe executive remuneration and reward framework has four components:\\n\\n- base pay and non-monetary benefits;\\n- short-term performance incentives;\\n- long-term incentives; and\\n- other remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave.\\n\\nThe combination of these comprises the executive's total remuneration.\\n\\nFixed remuneration, consisting of base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits, are reviewed annually by the Board based on individual and business unit performance, the overall performance of the Group and comparable market remunerations.\\n\\nExecutives may receive their fixed remuneration in the form of cash or other fringe benefits (for example motor vehicle benefits) where it does not create any additional costs to the Group and provides additional value to the executive.\\n\\n## Equity instruments\\n\\n## (i) Loan funded share plan\\n\\nIn the loan funded share plan, shares are purchased by the participant and funded by a loan provided by the Company. The shares are held by the participant until they vest (or are forfeited) and are eligible for dividends. Should the Company pay dividends or make capital distributions in the future, any dividends paid or distributions made to the participant will be applied to repay the loan and to meet the tax liability on those dividends or distributions.\\n\\nThe loan is for a period of 10 years from issue, is limited recourse and interest free. The loan is repayable in full on the earlier of the termination date of the loan or when the shares are sold.\\n\\nIn the event that the vesting / performance conditions are not met and shares do not vest for any other reason, the shares will be compulsorily acquired by the Company for the value of the outstanding loan.\\n\\nThe shares are forfeited in the event that the participant ceases employment prior to vesting. Where there is a change of control event, the Board may at its discretion make a determination that some or all of a participant's unvested shares may vest.\\n\\nFor accounting purposes, the loan funded share plan is treated and valued as options.\\n\\n## (ii) Share options\\n\\nSelected KMP and directors are made individual offers of specific numbers of share options at the discretion of the Board. The Board may determine the number of share options, vesting conditions, vesting period, exercise price and expiry date. Share options may be granted at any time, subject to the Corporations Act and ASX Listing Rules.\\n\\nThe grant of share options is designed to attract and provide appropriate incentives to directors and KMP who have recently joined the Group and/or relocated. These share options are subject to time-based vesting. There are no specific performance conditions attached to the vesting of those options as the early stage of the Group's business does not readily allow for the returns and results of the performance by executives to be measured quantitatively on a regular basis.\\n\\n## (iii) Ordinary share issues\\n\\nThe Board may offer KMP and selected directors' incentives that are settled in ordinary shares of the Company from time to time. This assists the Board in balancing the needs of the Company, while providing an appropriate mix of cash and non-cash incentives to directors and KMP.\\n\\n## Short-term incentive plan ('STIP')\\n\\nThe Chief Executive Officer and the KMP are eligible to participate in the STIP in a manner determined by the Board from time to time. Participants in the STIP have a target cash payment which is set as a percentage of their total fixed annual remuneration, subject to a maximum target of 100% for the Chief Executive Officer, 75% for the Chief Technology Officer and 15% for the Chief Financial Officer.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Directors' report 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nPayments under the STIP in any given year depend on the achievement of a range of financial and non-financial key performance indicators and objectives ('KPIs') for both the participant and the Group overall. Bonus awards granted to KMP may be settled in either cash or equity instruments of the Company at the discretion of the Board.\\n\\nAmounts awarded under the STIP to KMP during the year were in connection with the Company achieving revenue targets; securing new customers and contracts; expanding the Company's sales pipeline; delivering new products to market; eliminating technical debt and achieving new product integrations.\\n\\n## Long-term incentive plan ('LTIP')\\n\\nKMP, including non-executive directors, are eligible to participate in the LTIP as determined by the Board. The LTIP is designed to align the long-term goals of the Group with those of the KMP. The LTIP comprises the share options and loan funded shares.\\n\\nFollowing the annual general meeting on 16 October 2018, shareholders approved the renewal of the Employee Share Option Plan ('ESOP'). This plan, in addition to the existing Employee Loan Share Plan ('ELSP'), provides the Company with the means to incentivise its KMP with instruments that have the purpose of aligning the medium to long-term goals of the Board with the success of the Group.\\n\\n## Share options and loan funded share plan shares issued under the LTIP\\n\\nThe following grants were provided to the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors of the Group during the year ended 31 March 2020:\\n\\n- Loan funded share plan shares granted to Graham Mirabito on 11 November 2019, with components as follows:\\n\\n133,300 shares with a loan price of 30c, a term of 10 years and vest in the following tranches: 50% on 31 October 2020 and 6.25% to vest quarterly for the remaining 8 calendar quarters.\\n\\nThere were no grants provided to other KMP during the year ended 31 March 2020.\\n\\n## Future grants\\n\\nThe Board may consider amending the vesting terms and the performance hurdles from time to time to ensure that they are aligned to market practices and to ensure the best outcomes for the Group. The Board has the absolute discretion to replace the LTIP in any one or more years with an equivalent LTIP or any other program.\\n\\n## Consolidated entity performance and link to remuneration\\n\\nAny amount that may be awarded to the participants under the STIP is subject to the absolute discretion of the Board, and will be subject to the approval of the Board, after taking into account performance against KPIs, and any other matters determined by the Board to be relevant at its discretion including, without limitation, the participant's conduct and the financial performance and position of the Group.\\n\\n## Use of remuneration consultants\\n\\nDuring the financial year ended 31 March 2020, the Group did not engage remuneration consultants, to review its existing remuneration policies and provide recommendations on how to improve both the STI and LTI programs.\\n\\n## Voting and comments made at the Company's 2019 Annual General Meeting ('AGM')\\n\\nAt the 2019 AGM, 88% of the votes received supported the adoption of the remuneration report for the 9 months ended 31 March 2019. The Company did not receive any specific feedback at the AGM regarding its remuneration practices.\\n\\n## Details of remuneration\\n\\nDetails of the remuneration of the KMP of the Group are set out in the following tables. Remuneration paid in US dollars is converted to Australian dollars using a weighted-average exchange rate determined each month during the year.\\n\\nThe options and rights on the following table include the fair-value expense recognition for the loan funded share plan and share option plan.\\n\\n## Amounts of remuneration\\n\\nDetails of the remuneration of key management personnel of the Group are set out in the following tables.\\n\\n## (Formerly known as Covata Limited)\\n\\n## Cipherpoint Limited Directors' report\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## 31 March 2020\\n\\nThe key management personnel of the Group consisted of the following directors of Cipherpoint Limited:\\n\\n- Edward Pretty -

-->\\n\\n## Note 1. General information\\n\\nThe financial statements cover Cipherpoint Limited (the 'Company' or 'parent entity') as a consolidated entity consisting of Cipherpoint Limited and the entities it controlled ('the Group') at the end of, or during, the year. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is Cipherpoint Limited's functional and presentation currency.\\n\\nThe Group changed its financial year from 30 June to 31 March. The financial statements have been prepared for the 12 months ended 31 March 2020. The comparative accounting period is for the 9 months ended 31 March 2019; therefore, the results are not directly comparable.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited is a listed public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its registered office and principal place of business is:\\n\\nSuite 4, Level 8, 171 Clarence Street Sydney, NSW 2000\\n\\nA description of the nature of the Group's operations and its principal activities are included in the directors' report, which is not part of the financial statements.\\n\\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue, in accordance with a resolution of directors, on 18 May 2020.\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies\\n\\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\\n\\n## New or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted\\n\\nThe Group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') that are mandatory for the current reporting period.\\n\\nAny new or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.\\n\\nThe following Accounting Standards and Interpretations are most relevant to the Group:\\n\\n## AASB 16 Leases\\n\\nThe Group has adopted AASB 16 from 1 April 2019. The standard replaces AASB 117 'Leases' and for lessees eliminates the classifications of operating leases and finance leases. Except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position. Straight-line operating  lease  expense  recognition  is  replaced  with  a  depreciation  charge  for  the  right-of-use  assets  (included  in operating costs) and an interest expense on the recognised lease liabilities (included in finance costs). In the earlier periods of the lease, the expenses associated with the lease under AASB 16 will be higher when compared to lease expenses under AASB 117. However, EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) results improve as the operating expense is now replaced by interest expense and depreciation in profit or loss. For classification within the statement of cash flows, the interest portion is disclosed in operating activities and the principal portion of the lease payments are separately disclosed in financing activities. For lessor accounting, the standard does not substantially change how a lessor accounts for leases.\\n\\n## Cipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\n## Impact of adoption\\n\\nAASB 16 was adopted using the modified retrospective approach and as such the comparatives have not been restated. The impact of adoption on opening accumulated losses as at 1 April 2019 was nil as follows:\\n\\n|                                                            | 1 April   |\\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\\n|                                                            | 2019      |\\n|                                                            | $'000     |\\n| Operating lease commitments as at 1 April 2019 (AASB 117)  | 202,881   |\\n| Short term leases not recognised as a right-of-use asset   | (82,851)  |\\n| Operating lease extinguished through divestment            | (120,030) |\\n| Reduction on opening accumulated losses as at 1 April 2019 | -         |\\n\\nIn October 2019, the Group committed to another short-term lease of one year, that will continue to be accounted for as an expense as incurred and not capitalised as a right-of use asset and corresponding lease liability.\\n\\n## Practical expedients applied\\n\\nIn adopting AASB 16, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard:\\n\\n- applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics;\\n- accounted for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 April 2019 as short-term leases;\\n- excluded initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; and\\n- used hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease.\\n\\n## Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax\\n\\nThe Group has adopted Interpretation 23 from 1 April 2019. The interpretation clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements of AASB 112 'Income Taxes' in circumstances where uncertain tax treatments exists. The interpretation requires: the Group to determine whether each uncertain tax treatment should be treated separately or together, based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty; the Group to consider whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment; and if the Group concludes that it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, it shall reflect the effect of uncertainty in determining the related  taxable  profit  (tax  loss),  tax  bases,  unused  tax  losses,  unused  tax  credits  or  tax  rates,  measuring  the  tax uncertainty based on either the most likely amount or the expected value. In making the assessment it is assumed that a taxation authority will examine amounts it has a right to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when making  those  examinations. Interpretation  23  was  adopted  using  the  modified  retrospective  approach  and  as  such comparatives have not been restated. There was no impact of adoption on opening retained profits as at 1 April 2019.\\n\\n## Going concern\\n\\nThe financial statements of the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuation of normal business operations and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.\\n\\nThe Group is in the commercialisation stage of its data security technology. During the year ended 31 March 2020, the Group incurred a loss after tax of $673,045 (2019: $8,333,570), current assets exceeded current liabilities by $416,671 and incurred net cash outflows from operating activities of $3,703,746 (2019: $4,370,019). At 31 March 2020, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $920,935 (2019: $1,605,067). The Group has prepared cashflow forecasts as at 31 March 2020 to determine the appropriateness of the going concern assumption.\\n\\nThe key assumptions underlying these forecasts are as follows:\\n\\n- Completion of a capital raising in the amount of $500,000 from existing shareholders by June 2020 and additional capital raising when and as required;\\n- The Company securing on-going renewals and licence fees from existing and new customers; and\\n- Management continuing to maintain costs in line with available resources.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nThe inability to complete the above key assumptions would have a material impact on the anticipated trading results and cash flows, which gives rise to a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. In this event the Group may not be able to realise its assets and settle its liabilities in the normal course of operation and at the amounts stated in the financial statements. The Directors are confident of realising these objectives and accordingly they believe the going concern assumption is appropriate to the Group.\\n\\nHowever, forecast events may not occur as expected as many external and internal factors impact on future events. In the  event  that  these  objectives  are  not  realised,  directors  have  in  place  a  strategy  to  restructure  commitments  and expenditure in order to manage the Group's cash flows so that it is able to continue as a going concern.\\n\\n## Basis of preparation\\n\\nThese general-purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate for for-profit oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').\\n\\n## Historical cost convention\\n\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. Historical cost is generally based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.\\n\\n## Critical accounting estimates\\n\\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the use  of certain critical  accounting  estimates. It  also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.\\n\\n## Change of financial year end\\n\\nIn 2019, the Group changed its financial year from 30 June to 31 March. The financial statements have been prepared for the year ended 31 March 2020, while the comparative accounting period is for the 9 months ended 31 March 2019, therefore the results are not directly comparable.\\n\\n## Parent entity information\\n\\nIn  accordance  with  the  Corporations  Act  2001,  these  financial  statements  present  the  results  of  the  Group  only. Supplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 28.\\n\\n## Principles of consolidation\\n\\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Cipherpoint Limited as at 31 March 2020 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.\\n\\nSubsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\\n\\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the Group are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.\\n\\nThe acquisition  of  subsidiaries  is  accounted  for  using  the  acquisition  method  of  accounting.  A  change  in  ownership interest,  without  the  loss  of  control,  is  accounted  for  as  an  equity  transaction,  where  the  difference  between  the consideration transferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable to the parent.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nWhere  the  Group  loses  control  over  a  subsidiary,  it  derecognises  the  assets  including  goodwill,  liabilities  and  noncontrolling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The Group recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or loss in profit or loss.\\n\\n## Operating segments\\n\\nOperating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented is on the same basis as the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM'). The CODM is responsible for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.\\n\\n## Foreign currency translation\\n\\n## Foreign currency transactions\\n\\nForeign currency transactions are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.\\n\\n## Foreign operations\\n\\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.\\n\\nThe foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.\\n\\n## Revenue recognition\\n\\nThe Group recognises revenue as follows:\\n\\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\\n\\nRevenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the Group: identifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services promised.\\n\\nVariable  consideration  within  the  transaction  price,  if  any,  reflects  concessions  provided  to  the  customer  such  as discounts, rebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is  highly  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  in  the  amount  of  cumulative  revenue  recognised  will  not  occur.  The measurement  constraint  continues  until  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  variable  consideration  is  subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject to the constraining principle are initially recognised as deferred revenue in the form of a separate refund liability.\\n\\n## Rendering of services\\n\\nRevenue from a contract to provide services is recognised over time as the services are rendered based on either a fixed price or an hourly rate.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nTechnology related products and services are comprised of the following services:\\n\\n## (a) Software licence\\n\\nFor a sale of a software licence that the Group is not subject to significant integration services or continued maintenance and support, control transfers at the point in time the customer takes undisputed delivery of the goods. When such items are either customised or sold together with significant integration services, the goods and services represent a single combined performance obligation over which control is considered to transfer over time. This is because the combined product is unique to each customer (has no alternative use) and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for the work completed to date. Revenue for these performance obligations is recognised over time as the Group continues to support the license.\\n\\n## (b) Maintenance and support\\n\\nThe Group enters into maintenance and support contracts with its customers generally between one and three years in length, which includes customer support, updates and upgrades. Customers generally pay in advance for each 12-month service period and the relevant payment due dates are specified in each contract. Revenue is recognised over the life of the contract.\\n\\n## Research and development tax concession\\n\\nResearch and development tax incentives are recognised in the profit or loss when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attached to them.\\n\\n## Interest calculated using the effective interest method\\n\\nInterest is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.\\n\\n## Income tax\\n\\nThe  income  tax  expense  or  benefit  for  the  period  is  the  tax  payable  on  that  period's  taxable  income  based  on  the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable.\\n\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for:\\n\\n- When the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or\\n- When the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.\\n\\nThe carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset.\\n\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle simultaneously.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nCipherpoint  Limited  (the  'head  entity')  and  its  wholly  owned  Australian  subsidiaries  have  formed  an  income  tax consolidated group under the tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the 'separate taxpayer  within  group'  approach  in  determining  the  appropriate  amount  of  taxes  to  allocate  to  members  of  the  tax consolidated group.\\n\\nIn addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group.\\n\\nAssets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. The tax funding arrangement ensures that the intercompany charge equals the current tax liability or benefit of each tax consolidated group member, resulting in neither a contribution by the head entity to the subsidiaries nor a distribution by the subsidiaries to the head entity.\\n\\n## Discontinued operations\\n\\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results  of  discontinued  operations  are  presented  separately  on  the  face  of  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  and  other comprehensive income.\\n\\n## Current and non-current classification\\n\\nAssets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification.\\n\\nAn asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or  intended to be sold or consumed in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current.\\n\\nA liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.\\n\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.\\n\\n## Cash and cash equivalents\\n\\nCash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\\n\\n## Trade and other receivables\\n\\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for expected credit losses. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days.\\n\\nThe Group has applied the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days overdue.\\n\\nOther receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any allowance for expected credit losses.\\n\\n## Derivative financial instruments\\n\\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nDerivatives are classified as current or non-current depending on the expected period of realisation.\\n\\n## Non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale\\n\\nNon-current assets and assets of disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continued use. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. For non-current assets or assets of disposal groups to be classified as held for sale, they must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and their sale must be highly probable.\\n\\nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write down of the non-current assets and assets of disposal groups to fair value less costs of disposal. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs of disposal  of  non-current  assets  and  assets  of  disposal  groups,  but  not  in  excess  of  any  cumulative  impairment  loss previously recognised.\\n\\nNon-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale. Interest and other expenses attributable to the liabilities of assets held for sale continue to be recognised.\\n\\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of disposal groups classified as held for sale are presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position, in current assets. The liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale are presented separately on the face of the statement of financial position, in current liabilities.\\n\\n## Property, plant and equipment\\n\\nPlant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.\\n\\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment over their expected useful lives as follows:\\n\\nLeasehold improvement\\n\\nOver the lease term 1.5 - 5 years\\n\\nPlant and equipment\\n\\nThe residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.\\n\\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter.\\n\\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the Group. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss.\\n\\n## Leases\\n\\nThe company has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred.\\n\\n## Intangible assets\\n\\nIntangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, other than goodwill, are initially measured at their fair value at the date of the acquisition. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at cost. Indefinite life intangible assets are not amortised and are subsequently measured at cost less any impairment. Finite life intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less amortisation and any impairment. The gains or losses recognised in profit or loss arising from the derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the intangible asset. The method and useful lives of finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually. Changes in the expected pattern of consumption or useful life are accounted for prospectively by changing the amortisation method or period.\\n\\n## Intellectual property\\n\\nSignificant costs associated with intellectual property are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit, being their life of 4-5 years.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\\n\\nNon-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.\\n\\nRecoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-tax discount rate specific to the asset or cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped together to form a cash-generating unit.\\n\\n## Trade and other payables\\n\\nThese amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature they  are measured at amortised cost and are  not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.\\n\\n## Contract liabilities\\n\\nContract liabilities represent the Group's obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer and are recognised when a  customer  pays  consideration,  or  when  the  Group  recognises  a  receivable  to  reflect  its  unconditional  right  to consideration (whichever is earlier) before the Group has transferred the goods or services to the customer.\\n\\n## Borrowings\\n\\nLoans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\\n\\n## Convertible notes\\n\\nThe convertible notes are classified as a liability in the statement of financial position, net of transaction costs due to the conversion features within the notes being the obligation to deliver a variable number of shares on settlement.\\n\\nOn the issue of the convertible notes the fair value of the liability is recognised as cash received net of transaction costs and this amount is carried as a non-current liability on the amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion, maturity or redemption. The interest on convertible notes is expensed to profit or loss using the effective interest method.\\n\\n## Finance costs\\n\\nFinance costs attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the asset. All other finance costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\\n\\n## Employee benefits\\n\\n## Short-term employee benefits\\n\\nLiabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.\\n\\n## Other long-term employee benefits\\n\\nThe liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to  the  reporting  date.  Consideration  is  given  to  expected  future  wage  and  salary  levels,  experience  of  employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\\n\\n## Share-based payments\\n\\nEquity-settled share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees.\\n\\nEquity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the rendering of services. Cash-settled transactions are awards of cash for the exchange of services, where the amount of cash is determined by reference to the share price.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nMarket  conditions  are  taken  into  consideration  in  determining  fair  value.  Therefore,  any  awards  subject  to  market conditions are considered to vest irrespective of whether or not that market condition has been met, provided all other conditions are satisfied.\\n\\nIf equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification.\\n\\nIf the non-vesting condition is within the control of the Group or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the Group or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period,  any  remaining  expense  for  the  award  is  recognised  over  the  remaining  vesting  period,  unless  the  award  is forfeited.\\n\\nIf  equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they were a modification.\\n\\n## Fair value measurement\\n\\nWhen an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal market; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.\\n\\nFair  value is  measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming they act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use. Valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, are used, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\\n\\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified into three levels, using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. Classifications are reviewed at each reporting date and transfers between levels are determined based on a reassessment of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\\n\\nFor recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements, external valuers may be used when internal expertise is either not available or when the valuation is deemed to be significant. External valuers are selected based on market knowledge and reputation. Where there is a significant change in fair value of an asset or liability from one period to another, an analysis is undertaken, which includes a verification of the major inputs applied in the latest valuation and a comparison, where applicable, with external sources of data.\\n\\n## Earnings per share\\n\\n## Basic earnings per share\\n\\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Cipherpoint Limited, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year.\\n\\n## Diluted earnings per share\\n\\nDiluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of shares assumed to have been issued for no consideration in relation to dilutive potential ordinary shares.\\n\\n## Goods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes\\n\\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of financial position.\\n\\nCash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash flows.\\n\\nCommitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority.\\n\\n## New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted\\n\\nAustralian  Accounting  Standards  and  Interpretations  that  have  recently  been  issued  or  amended  but  are  not  yet mandatory, have not been early adopted by the Group for the annual reporting period ended 31 March 2020. The Group's assessment of the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations, most relevant to the Group, are set out below.\\n\\n## New Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting\\n\\nA revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting has been issued by the AASB and is applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. This release impacts for-profit private sector entities that have public accountability that are required by legislation to comply with Australian Accounting Standards and other for-profit entities that voluntarily elect to apply the Conceptual Framework. Phase 2 of the framework is yet to be released which will  impact  for-profit  private  sector  entities.  The  application  of  new  definition  and  recognition  criteria  as  well  as  new guidance  on  measurement  will  result  in  amendments  to  several  accounting  standards.  The  issue  of  AASB  2019-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - References to the Conceptual Framework, also applicable from 1 January 2020, includes such amendments. Where the Group has relied on the conceptual framework in determining its accounting policies for transactions, events or conditions that are not otherwise dealt with under Australian Accounting Standards, the Group may need to revisit such policies. The Group will apply the revised conceptual framework from 1 April 2020 and is yet to assess its impact.\\n\\n## Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\\n\\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and  assumptions  on  historical  experience  and  on  other  various  factors,  including  expectations  of  future  events, management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are discussed below.\\n\\n## Share-based payment transactions\\n\\nThe Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using either the Black-Scholes model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The accounting estimates and assumptions relating to equity-settled share-based payments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period but may impact profit or loss and equity.\\n\\n## Allowance for expected credit losses\\n\\nThe allowance for expected credit losses assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. It is based on the lifetime expected credit loss, grouped based on days overdue, and makes assumptions to allocate an overall expected credit loss rate for each group. These assumptions include recent sales experience and historical collection rates.\\n\\n## Cipherpoint Limited\\n\\n(Formerly known as Covata Limited)\\n\\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\\n\\n31 March 2020\\n\\n## Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)\\n\\n## Goodwill\\n\\nThe Group tests annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2. The recoverable amounts of cashgenerating  units  have  been  determined  based  on  value-in-use  calculations.  These  calculations  require  the  use  of assumptions, including estimated discount rates based on the current cost of capital and growth rates of the estimated future cash flows.\\n\\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\\n\\nThe Group assesses impairment of non-financial assets at each reporting date by evaluating conditions specific to the Group and to the particular asset that may lead to impairment. If an impairment trigger exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is determined. This involves fair value less costs of disposal or value-in-use calculations, which incorporate a number of key estimates and assumptions.\\n\\n## Income tax\\n\\nThe  Group  is  subject  to  income  taxes  in  the  jurisdictions  in  which  it  operates.  Significant  judgement  is  required  in determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on the Group's current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the carrying amounts, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.\\n\\n## Recovery of deferred tax assets\\n\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences only if the Group considers it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.\\n\\n## Note 4. Operating segments\\n\\n## Identification of reportable operating segments\\n\\nThe Group operates in one segment, based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors (who are identified as the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM')) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources.\\n\\nAs a result, the operating segment information is as disclosed in the statements and notes to the financial statements throughout the report.\\n\\nNo seasonality in the business segment has been identified that would have a significant impact on the results of the Group.\\n\\n## Note 5.

During the period ended 31 March 2019, the Company announced a major transformational acquisition and further capital raising. As a consequence of these changes and uncertainty  around  the  availability  of  resources  to  further  utilise  the  existing  CipherPoint  business,  management determined that it was prudent to recognise an impairment of the acquired goodwill of $894,713.\\n\\nFor the period ended 31 March 2019, the Group also assessed internal impairment indicators in relation to the intellectual property of Eclipse and the carrying amount was greater than the value in use therefore an impairment loss of $932,854 was recognised in profit or loss at 31 March 2019.\\n\\nFor the year ended 31 March 2020, the Group has assessed internal and external impairment indicators in relation to the intellectual property of the acquired dataglobal IP. However, the value in use calculations were speculative as the Group has  one  year's  history  of  sales  and  cannot  accurately  predict  future  growth.  Consequently,  an  impairment  loss  of $959,385 (2019: $0) was recognised in profit or loss at 31 March 2020.\\n\\nThe divestment of SafeShare included a global, perpetual, royalty-free licence of the IP and platforms developed by Cocoon and Covata Australia Pty Limited ('CVA') back to Cipherpoint for use in its ongoing businesses, other than to be used for a development of a product not connected to the Group's core product range. The Group recognised a fair value of $70,000 at 16 July 2019 and fully impaired the written down value of $53,443 during the year ended 31 March 2020.\\n\\n## Note 13.

Equity - dividends\\n\\nThere were no dividends paid, recommended or declared during the current or previous financial year.\\n\\n## Note 22. Financial instruments\\n\\n## Financial risk management objectives\\n\\nThe Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk, price risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.\\n\\nThe Group's policy is not to trade in or use financial instruments to hedge its risks.\\n\\nRisk management is carried out by the Board of Directors ('the Board'). The Board uses different methods to measure different types of risks to which the Group is exposed. These methods include ageing analysis for credit risk and sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate risk.\\n\\n## Market risk\\n\\n## Foreign currency risk\\n\\nThe Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currency and is exposed to foreign currency risk through foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\\n\\nForeign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised financial assets and financial liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the entity's functional currency. The risk is measured using sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting.\\n\\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales, purchases and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Group companies. The currencies in which transactions are denominated are primarily US dollars (USD), Australian dollars (AUD), British pounds (GBP) and Euros (EUR), whilst cash and cash equivalents and term deposits are predominantly denominated in Australian dollars.\\n\\nThe carrying amount of the Group's foreign currency denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting date were as follows:\\n\\n|              | Assets        | Assets        | Liabilities   | Liabilities   |\\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\\n| Consolidated | 31 Mar 2020 $ | 31 Mar 2019 $ | 31 Mar 2020 $ | 31 Mar 2019 $ |\\n| USD          | 84,454        | 184,287       | (207,925)     | (67,621)      |\\n| EUR          | 177,027       | 36,687        | (49,739)      | (473,190)     |\\n| GBP          | 18,267        | 47,874        | -             | (5,740)       |\\n|              | 279,748       | 268,848       | (257,664)     | (546,551)     |\\n\\nA strengthening/(weakening) of the AUD against the GBP, USD or EUR by 10 percent at the reporting date would have decreased/(increased) equity and profit/(loss) for the year by the amounts shown.

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.\\n\\n## Foreign operations\\n\\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.\\n\\nThe foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.\\n\\n## Revenue recognition\\n\\nThe Group recognises revenue as follows:\\n\\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\\n\\nRevenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the Group: identifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services promised.\\n\\nVariable  consideration  within  the  transaction  price,  if  any,  reflects  concessions  provided  to  the  customer  such  as discounts, rebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is  highly  probable  that  a  significant  reversal  in  the  amount  of  cumulative  revenue  recognised  will  not  occur.  The measurement  constraint  continues  until  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  variable  consideration  is  subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject to the constraining principle are initially recognised as deferred revenue in the form of a separate refund liability.\\n\\n## Rendering of services\\n\\nRevenue from a contract to provide services is recognised over time as the services are rendered based on either a fixed price or an hourly rate.\\n\\nCipherpoint Limited (Formerly known as Covata Limited) Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 March 2020\\n\\n## Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)\\n\\nTechnology related products and services are comprised of the following services:\\n\\n## (a) Software licence\\n\\nFor a sale of a software licence that the Group is not subject to significant integration services or continued maintenance and support, control transfers at the point in time the customer takes undisputed delivery of the goods. When such items are either customised or sold together with significant integration services, the goods and services represent a single combined performance obligation over which control is considered to transfer over time. This is because the combined product is unique to each customer (has no alternative use) and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for the work completed to date. Revenue for these performance obligations is recognised over time as the Group continues to support the license.\\n\\n## (b) Maintenance and support\\n\\nThe Group enters into maintenance and support contracts with its customers generally between one and three years in length, which includes customer support, updates and upgrades. Customers generally pay in advance for each 12-month service period and the relevant payment due dates are specified in each contract. Revenue is recognised over the life of the contract.\\n\\n## Research and development tax concession\\n\\nResearch and development tax incentives are recognised in the profit or loss when there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attached to them.\")]\n"
